replace YOUR_SYSTEM_USER with the username you have

sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since it was a new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> CREATE USER 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWD';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost';
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='auth_socket' WHERE User='YOUR_SYSTEM_USER';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;

sudo service mysql restart


auth_socket make password setup not working
  use: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
  
check if using password: 
  SELECT User, Host, HEX(authentication_string) FROM mysql.user;
  
check plugin: 
  SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user;
