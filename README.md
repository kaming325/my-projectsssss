## money_change 

It is a java program that allows me and my colleagues not to calculate every order,
and to save orders to database (i use mysql for this) so that we can settle accounts and go back home 
faster than ever : )

## money_change2 and money_change_backend

'money_change_backend' is a java spring boot api that saves and gets data from mongodb by http request, and 
'money_change2' is a kotlin version of 'money_change' and implements the api, so it is a online version of money_change1. <br/>
Also i have learnt how to build and make executable jar file from gradle (kotlin)
